Inside of the file you will find 3 differnt things
1) the main python file named Stern_Max_Midterm.py. This is the main program that includes Brute force, apriori library, and FRgrowth library iterations of the program.
2) the Jupyter notebook named Stern_Max_Midterm.ipynb. This is the jupyter notebook containing the program breakdown, comments on how it works piece by piece, as well as showing what the data frame looks like step by step and how the brute force program works.
3) 5 csv files named after retailers. those are the transactions and should be located in the same folder as the main program (Stern_Max_Midterm.py) and the jupyter notebook (Stern_Max_Midterm.ipynb) when the program is executed.
